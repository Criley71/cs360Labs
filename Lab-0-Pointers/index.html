<b>Video help</b>: I've made a video of doing the test below (<a href=test.html>test.html</a>),

Lab zero is really a quiz, which will be conducted during lab.  Please see the class web
site for the date.  The questions for the quiz will be <i>exactly</i> like the questions 
in this lab.  Therefore, use this as practice for the quiz.

<p>
For each of your practice sessions, log into a lab machine.  There is the following program
in the lab directory, which you call as follows:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
/home/jplank/cs360/labs/Lab-0-Pointers/pointer-tester <i>key</i> <i>action</i>
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <i>key</i> may be any string -- the string is used to generate a random test.
If you use the action <tt>"Q"</tt>, then it will print a test, in HTML, on standard
output.  Let's go ahead and generate a test with the key "binky":

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>/home/jplank/cs360/labs/Lab-0-Pointers/pointer-tester binky Q > test.html</b></font>
</pre>

You can see the test here: <a href=test.html>test.html</a>.
The first line of the test tells you what its key is.  For example, the first line
of <b><a href=test.html>test.html</a></b> is "Lab Zero. HTML file for key binky:".
<p>
The test is composed of 25
questions.  Each time you generate a test, it will be similar in format, but the
questions will be different.  The content depends on the key given.

<p>
When you answer the questions, create a text file with the answers.  
The first line of an answer file should be the key.  
After that, 
each answer should go on its own line,
and each line should be of the form:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
number answer
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <i>number</i> is the question number, and the <i>answer</i> is your answer.  
Take a look at the file <b><a href=answers.txt>answers.txt</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
binky
0 0x12345678
1 12345678
12 0x91
</pre></td></table></center><p>

As you can see, I have put the key "binky" as the first line.  After that, 
I have answered questions 0, 1 and 12.  I can tell you that the answer to questions
0 and 1 are incorrect.  Question 1's answer is in the wrong format, too (it doesn't match the
<b>printf()</b> statement in the question).  The answer to question 12 is correct.
<p>
You can test your answers for correctness, by calling 
<b>/home/jplank/cs360/labs/Lab-0-Pointers/pointer-tester</b> with the same key that created the HTML file, 
but with a <tt>"T"</tt> (for "test") instead of a <tt>"Q"</tt> (for "questions").  Redirect
standard input to come from your answer file.  The program
will report your answers and whether or not they are correct.  
<p>
Here's our example:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>/home/jplank/cs360/labs/Lab-0-Pointers/pointer-tester binky T < answers.txt</b></font>

<hr>
Remember -- when you use '%x', all of the digits are lower case.
<hr>
A word of advice -- you will find the <b>endian.c</b> program in the
"C Stuff 2" lecture notes (<a
href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-2/lecture.html>http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-2/lecture.html</a>)
to be very helpful in doing this lab.  You should read over that
program and its accompanying writeup before doing this lab.

<h3>The Quiz</h3>

As I said above, you'll be quizzed on this in a timed quiz during lab.  The web site /
Canvas site will tell you when that is.  The quiz itself will be in the exact same
format -- question numbers will be different, but the format of the questions will be
the same.  If you're not rock solid on this material, use this lab as study material
and practice, practice, practice.
